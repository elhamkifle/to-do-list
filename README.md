# to-do-list

This is a simple web application that allows you to create and manage your tasks in separate work and personal to-do lists. With this application, you can easily keep track of your tasks and stay organized.
The personal to do list has an input for a task, while the work to do list has an additional field to assign a task to a particular person, and a deadline to indicate when the work is due.

## Features

- Create tasks: Add new tasks to your work or personal to-do list.
- Delete tasks: Remove tasks from your to-do list when they are completed or no longer needed.
- Mark tasks as finished: Mark tasks as finished to keep track of your progress.
- Separate work and personal lists: Keep your work and personal tasks separate for better organization.
- Save tasks: Your tasks are automatically saved to local storage, so you can access them even after closing the application.

## Getting Started

To use this application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will then see a link to open a personal to do list or a work to do list. Choose whichever, and you will see two input fields for adding tasks to your work and personal to-do lists. Enter a task in the respective input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list. You can delete a task by clicking the "Delete" button next to it. To mark a task as finished, click the "Finished" button.
